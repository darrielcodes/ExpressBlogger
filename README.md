## Class Notes

- .gitignore is the list of files that will be ignored by git
- we want node_modules to be ignored bc of large folder size
- w/other devs, we clone the repository without node_modules and the we run "npm i" to install node_modules
- generator - "boiler plate" - creates a bunch of code when ran (like express-generator)
